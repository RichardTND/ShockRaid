SHOCK RAID

It is the year 2197. An alien planet, Zarjon has spiralled out of control and is heading towards planet Earth. We have sent in a few pilots and scientists to find out what has caused this planet to fly so quickly towards our planet. It turns out that a crystal stored in the bottom of the mines appears to be the source. Our people tried to remove the crystal in order to stop the planet but they got destroyed by the alien forces. 

This is where you come in. Your mission is to enter the alien planet Zarjon. Fly through the 4 underground lairs and do battle against the aliens. You must ten located the crystal and destroy it in order to save Earth.

Your ship is charged with a limited number of shields. These will be lost if you collide into any aliens, their lasers or any other obstacles you come across. Once all of your shields are out our hope will be lost and Earth will be destroyed. You will be awarded an extra shield for every level completed also 1,000 points will be awarded as a bonus for you. 

Can you find the power crystal and destroy it or will life on Earth be no more? The fate of Earth lies in your hands. 

Good luck Pilot.
