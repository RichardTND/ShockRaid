# ShockRaid
Shock Raid is a 4-level fast paced vertical scrolling (Not SEUCK) shoot 'em up which is currently being written for Reset Magazine. The game concept aims to be a short term concept, and will play similar to games like Zap Zone and X-Force. Due to deadline management. 

The game is currently developed in C64Studio and should also work on ACME cross assembler, since the syntax of the code is literally the same.
